		<h2> (100) Days of Starmer </h2>
			<h3> What polling means for Keir Starmer and potential future policy. </h3>

		<time datetime="17-07-2020"> July 18th, 2020 </time>
		<p class = "debug-center"> It’s been just over 100 days since Keir Starmer took over the Labour Party and one question has emerged more vocally than others. What is Starmerism and by extension Keir Starmer all about? </p>

 <p class="debug-center"> One thing that is evident is Starmer's personal popularity. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/11/competent-likeable-decisive-keir-starmer-beating-boris-johnson-on-all-counts">Recent Opinum polling puts him ahead of Boris Johnson in every personal category</a>:  </p>

 <div class = 'visualisation'> <iframe title="Opinium/Observer Poll 9th/10th July" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-vCOnr" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vCOnr/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="436"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script></div>

<p class="debug-center"> I want to point out the competency rating in particular, he is 24 points ahead of Johnson. The Cumming’s Barnard Castle affair I wrote about in <a href ="https://www.benchurchus.com/dominic-cummings-polling">the last blog post </a> seems to have had a lasting effect on the Prime Minister's rating. I also want to point out this poll is a net poll and a lot of people are still "Don't know" for Starmer. </p>

 <p class="debug-center"> Starmer also currently leads Johnson on a question of who would be a better Prime Minister <a href =" https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/sir-keir-starmer-better-boris-johnson-prime-minister-poll-a4482151.html"> with 37% answering Starmer over Johnson's 35%. </a> The numbers shift when we look at the wider team. On a question of who is better to run the economy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/11/competent-likeable-decisive-keir-starmer-beating-boris-johnson-on-all-counts"> Anneliese Dodds/Keir Starmer poll at 26% compared to the 42% of Rishi Sunak/Boris Johnson. </a> </p>

	
			<p class="debug-center">On the 8th June when Edward Colston’s statue was pulled down in Bristol, it was the day before his first <a href = "https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/special-shows/call-keir/keir-starmer-protesters-were-wrong-colston-statue/ "> ‘Call Keir’ LBC slot </a>.  What he thought about the situation he answered ‘Protesters were wrong, but Colston statue should have been removed long ago’ this put him in line with the majority of public opinion. </p>

		<div class = 'visualisation'><iframe title="YouGov Daily Polling 8th June" aria-label="Split bars" id="datawrapper-chart-7j9Wq" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7j9Wq/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="286"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script></div>

		<p class="debug-center">Interestingly, as Stephen Bush points out it was also a position that put him further left of Jeremy Corbyn who said <a href = "bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/what-jeremy-corbyn-said-colston-2099179"> ‘I think we should understand our past and not erase it, but we should also commemorate those who stood up against the slave trade.’ </a> When asked to comment on the, at the time, on-going debate of Colston in 2018.  </p>

<p class= 'debug-center'> Another story that broke into the newscycle was the removal of Rebecca Long-Bailey from the Shadow Education brief following retweeting a Maxine Peake article that contained untrue anti-Semitic dogwhistles. The prompt firing was something that resonated with the public with the plurality of people believing it was the right thing to do: </p>

<div class = 'visualisation'><iframe title="YouGov Daily Polling 26th June " aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-XQoaC" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XQoaC/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="301"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script></div>

 <p class="debug-center"> Often Starmerism has been linked to avoiding social issues however. There are dangers of this as <a href = "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-53267989">  Starmer found out when he spoke about BLM’s objective to defund the police and describing it as a 'moment'. </a> . Whilst his intention was not to dismiss it as a moment the clumsy language highlighted that the tightrope he’s walking with societal issues can be fallen off of. </p>

<p class= 'debug-center'>  Both Keir's position on the removal of Colston and work to combat anti-Semitism are not defining of Starmerism, but they do stand out as the decisions of the leadership falling in line public opinion. All of this has led to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/starmer-achieves-best-satisfaction-ratings-leader-opposition-blair"> Keir Starmer being the most popular opposition leader since Tony Blair. </a> Starmerism as it's first act seeks to professionalise the party and appear as competent. On a personal polling level he has already succeeded with that.
</p>

  <p class="debug-center">  <a href= "https://ukandeu.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Mind-the-values-gap.pdf"> 'The UK in a Changing Europe' report  </a> found that 2019 Labour-to-Conservative voters lean towards social values associated with authoritarianism rather than liberalism. The coalition of Labour voters is rarely aligned on social issues. </p>

<div class='images2'><img src="images/Figure8UKCE.png" alt="Figure 8 UK in Changing Europe"> </div>

 <p class="debug-center"> Following the electoral loss in 2019 the group Labour Together launched a commission to analyse the defeat. It was published last month. One of the central thesis of the Labour Together report is that Labour has been losing votes for the last 20 years, and that no coalition it has built in the last 10 is capable of winning a majority. One of the conclusions gives room for hope however, there is an opportunity for <a href = "https://docs.labourtogether.uk/Labour%20Together%202019%20Election%20Review.pdf"> ‘transformational economic change in the country, which our report suggests can win over a broad coalition of voters’ </a> </p>


 <p class="debug-center">  The findings from the Labour Together report are reinforced by the ‘The UK in a Changing Europe’ report, which shows that voters often sit far further to left on economic values than the Conservative MPs and members. </p>

<div class='images2'><img src="images/Figure6UKCE.png" alt="Figure 6 UK in Changing Europe"> </div>

 <p class="debug-center">  When Starmer does (eventually announce policy) it'll most likely be in line with his commitment during leadership to <a href="https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/">"Increase income tax for the top 5% of earners, reverse the Tories’ cuts in corporation tax and clamp down on tax avoidance, particularly of large corporations." </a> </p>



 <p class="debug-center"> Both the Labour Together Report, UK in a Changing Europe findings and his own leadership pledge all point to economic policy change, in particular for tax increases on the top 5%. So why has Keir stalled on announcing economic policy?</p>

 <p class="debug-center">  There are potentially a few reasons why Starmerism has had a lack of policy. Firstly he’s been doing other stuff. Namely changing the structures of the party. That requires a loyal cabinet united behind you (done), a loyal General Secretary (done) and requires a majority on the NEC (almost done). This first act is interconnected and is a lot of work out of the public eye. </p>

 <p class="debug-center"> The second reason is that we do not have the full scope of the recession that will inevitably come.  In a Post-Covid recession world would a corporation be able to handle an increase in corporation tax without being forced to restructure and cause large redundancies? It’s hard to imagine a corporation already disproportionately affected by Covid, for example British Airways, handling an increase. </p>

 <p class="debug-center">  It also factors into other policy decisions, such as a green policy to make to airline turbine fuel non-exempt from fuel duty. Any policy attempting a sector-by-sector corporate taxation policy is an absolute minefield. Any Labour green policy that proposes fuel duty on aviation turbine fuel will be met with airlines saying it’d be the final nail in the coffin for the industry and cost tens of thousands of jobs. </p>

 <p class="debug-center">  Rhetoric is easy, policy is complex. </p>

 <p class="debug-center">  Finally, there has not been a need to yet. We’re a long way out from a General Election and Labour have made up (and maintained) significant ground and narrowed the Tory lead. </p>

<p class="debug-center"> The polls over the last two months have shown little major change. I believe this is partially due to the popularity of Starmer not extending to his own front bench (yet) as seen in the Dodds/Starmer economic question I referred to earlier.  In order to increase Labour Westminster polling Starmer will need to boost the profile of his front bench. </p>


  <p class="debug-center">Starmerism is a long-term project though. 100 days down, 1384 until a General Election to go...   </p>
