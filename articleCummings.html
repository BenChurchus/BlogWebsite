		<h2> Brand Toxification and Competency: </h2>
			<h3> Why the Conservatives should be wary about what the initial polling numbers say about the Dominic Cummings Saga </h3>

		<time datetime="28-05-2020"> April 27th, 2020 </time>
		<p class = "debug-center"> Dominic Cummings and his trip(s) to Durham in March have dominated British news for the last 6 days. On Tuesday 26th, the first major round of polls came out from YouGov, JLPartners and Survation. They all tell the same story. People believe that Cummings has broken the rules and should resign. This has also knocked the Conservative cabinet. I’m going to highlight some polling numbers that I think have been overlooked and why brand toxification specifically in terms of competency could be the real consequence of this crisis. </p>


		<p class = "debug-center">  Following the news initially breaking on Friday 22nd public pressure forced Cummings into making a public statement. The statement made in the Rose Garden of Number 10, far from being remedial, arguably did more damage. JL Partner’s polling on how Cumming’s came across said 61% of people thought he was arrogant. Most notably was the lack of the apology in the statement, which beyond being plastered on the  <a href = 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-52802691'> front pages </a> also polled badly polled with the public. <a href = 'https://www.jlpartners.co.uk/polling-results'> 76% of people saying he was wrong not to apologise including 70% of Conservative voters. </a>
 		</p>

 		<div class = 'visualisation'> <iframe title="JL Partner's Polling 26th May 2020" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-Kid2g" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Kid2g/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="273"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script> </div>

		<p class = "debug-center"> MP for Moray, Douglas Ross was so unsatisfied following hearing Cumming's statement, he resigned. This  arguably gave a third wind to the story and with the resignation being one of the top stories for the 26th.   </p>


<!--		<figure class = "size-2"> </figure> -->

		<p class = "debug-center">  This led us into the evening of the 26th when the polls came out. Any hope of let-up of this story that the Government had was quickly quashed.  By then, polling indicated <a href = 'https://www.jlpartners.co.uk/polling-results'> 87% of people had heard a great deal/fair amount. </a> </p>

		<p class="debug-center"> Remarkably, there are vast similarities of opinion across the board: Left, Right, Leave, Remain, Young, Old. On YouGov’s question ‘It has been reported that in late March Dominic Cummings travelled from London to Durham to stay at a home on his parents' property while self-isolating with Coronavirus, in order to get help with childcare. Do you think this did or did not break the lockdown rules?’ 71% believe it did. </p>

		<p class="debug-center">One piece of polling data that I think has slipped through the net but is potentially the most important and damaging is the following: </p>

<div class = 'visualisation'> <iframe title="YouGov Daily Polling 26th May" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-1eEfI" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1eEfI/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="301"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script> </div>

<p class= 'debug-center'> Caveat of the visualisation above I have intentionally shown the data that adheres to the most relevant to the ‘Workington Man’ Swing voter, you can all of the data <a href = 'https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/05/26/e3651/2' > here. </a>


<p class= 'debug-center'>  The Cummings issue has already led to some indication of toxifying Boris Johnson in terms of competency. In the 2019 General Election the emergence of The Workington Man, a Labour voter in 2017, Leave voting Male between 40-55 had been seen as the key swing that caused the collapse of the Red Wall. Boris Johnson being seen as not been able to communicate his message has a distinct undertone of incompetence. Government's being able to effectively communicate messages is a reputation which may stick.  </p>

 <p class="debug-center">  We need only look at Labour’s 2019 Electoral Performance to see the fallout’s of a negative competency rating. Whilst Corbyn’s policies were popular  <a href = 'https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/01/09/eurotrack-corbyns-policies-popular-europe-and-uk'> individually </a> being juxtaposed next to public belief of the party to deliver them left a lot to be <a href = "https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/12/23/their-own-words-why-voters-abandoned-labour"> desired. </a>  </p>

 <p class="debug-center"> So to recap, people have heard about this story, they think it’s wrong, think it impacts the public and government's ability to communicate and.... now what? </p>

<p class="debug-center"> Westminster Voting intention as an indicator shows that the Conservative's lead over Labour is at the lowest it's been all year. Although, a wider look at voting intention shows the lead declining since mid-April. To simply place that on the Cumming's saga would be inappropriate. </p>

<div class = 'visualisation'> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/2599690" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/2599690/embed"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> </div>


 <p class="debug-center"> Ultimately, the longer the story drags out the amount of don’t knows will start to become do knows and the story will stick around. YouGov pollling 62% of people think the story is either very/somewhat important <a href = "https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/05/27/25d17/1"> including 49% of Conservative voters and 52% of Leave voters. </a> I imagine the Government will hope those numbers stay as they are or people get frustrated and tired of the story. 'Time to move on' has been a much repeated phrase from the Tory frontbenches, however the resignations and polling keep it in the newscycle. Any movement on the story will reignite the fire again. </p>


 <p class="debug-center">  The question of “What is so special about Dominic Cummings?” can quickly become "At does Dominic Cumming’s become not worth it?"" The fact that as of current count 40+ Conservative MPs are calling for his resignation is an indicator that many within the Party already feel that point has happened. The polling and argument’s I’ve outlined make my head think it’s an inevitability that Cummings will go. </p>

 <p class="debug-center">  However the lack of elections until next year, the bizarre times we live in and the shear amount of political capital the Cabinet and Prime Minister are exhausting lead my gut to think Cummings will hang on. Albeit with public's belief in Government messaging in tatters and Teflon Johnson taking his first major hit in a while... I await the competency polling. </p>
