		<p class = "debug-center"> Dominic Cummings and his trip(s) to Durham in March has dominated British news for the last 5 days. Last night, on the 26th, the first major round of polls came out from YouGov, JLPartners and Survation. They all tell the same story. People believe that Cummings has broken the rules and should resign. This has also knocked the Conservative cabinet. Beyond that though, I’m going to highlight some polling numbers that I think have been overlooked and why brand toxification specifically in terms of competency could be the real consequence of this crisis. </p>

		<h3> What happened. </h3>
		<p class = "debug-center">  What Cummings and now by extension the Government have sorely misjudged is that many people have had to make similar decisions and made the opposite one. The public statement in the Rose Garden of Number 10, far from being remedial, did arguably do more damage. JL Partner’s polling on how Cumming’s came across said  61% of people thought he was arrogant. Alongside that perception was the lack of the apology in the statement, which beyond being plastered on the front pages also sat even more uncomfortably with the public. <a href = 'https://www.jlpartners.co.uk/s/2605-Data-tables.xlsx'> 76% of people saying he was wrong not to apologise including 70% of Conservative voters. </a>
 		</p>

		<p class = "debug-center"> MP for Moray, Douglas Ross was so unsatisfied following hearing the statement he resigned. This  arguably gave a third wind to the story and with the resignation being one of the top stories for the 26th.   </p>


<!--		<figure class = "size-2"> </figure> -->

		<p class = "debug-center">  This led us into the evening of the 26th when the polls came out. Any hope of let-up of this story that the Government had been quickly quashed.  There isn’t much room for escape that people are unaware of this issue as polling indicated 87% of people had heard a great deal/fair amount. </p>

		<p class="debug-center"> Remarkably, there are vast similarities of opinion across the board: Left, Right, Leave, Remain, Young, Old. On YouGov’s question ‘It has been reported that in late March Dominic Cummings travelled from London to Durham to stay at a home on his parents' property while self-isolating with Coronavirus, in order to get help with childcare. Do you think this did or did not break the lockdown rules?’ 71% believe it did. </p>

		<p class="debug-center">One piece of polling data that I think has slipped through the net is the following: </p>

<iframe title="YouGov Daily Polling 26th May" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-1eEfI" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1eEfI/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="301"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

<p class= 'debug-center'> Caveat of the visualisation above I have intentionally shown the data that adheres to the most relevant to the ‘Workington Man’ Swing voter, you can access more of the data here <!--a href -->


<p class= 'debug-center'>  The Cummings issue has already led to some indication of toxifying Boris Johnson in terms of competency. The 2019 General Election the emergence of The Workington Man, a Labour voter in 2017, Leave voting Male between 40-55 had been seen as the key swing that caused the collapse of the Red Wall. Boris Johnson being seen as not been able to communicate his message has a distinct undertone of incompetence. Government's being able to effectively communicate messages is a reputation which may stick.  </p>

 <p class="debug-center">  We need only look at Labour’s 2019 Electoral Performance to see the fallout’s of a negative competency rating. Whilst Corbyn’s policies were popular  <a href = 'https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/01/09/eurotrack-corbyns-policies-popular-europe-and-uk'> individually </a> being juxtaposed next to public belief of the party to deliver them left a lot to be <a href = "https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/12/23/their-own-words-why-voters-abandoned-labour"> desired. </a>  </p>



 <p class="debug-center"> Back to Cummings. People have heard about it, they think it’s wrong and.... now what? The polls have particular resonance for the Conservatives because they indicate a potential toxification of the Conservative Government in terms of competency. </p>

 <p class="debug-center"> The longer the story drags out 62% of people think the story is either very/somewhat important think <a href = "https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/05/27/25d17/1"> including 49% of Conservative voters and 52% of Leave voters </a> The higher the amount of don’t knows start become do knows. Current polling suggests that they won’t fall into a Keep-Cummings camp. </p>


 <p class="debug-center">  The question of “What is so special about Dominic Cummings?” can quickly become "At does Dominic Cumming’s become not worth it?"" The fact that as of current count 40 Conservative MPs are calling for his resignation is an indicator that many within the Party already feel that point has happened. The polling and argument’s I’ve outlined make my head think it’s an inevitability that Cummings will go. </p>

 <p class="debug-center">  However the lack of elections until next year, the bizarre times we live in and the shear amount of political capital the Cabinet and Prime Minister are exhausting lead my gut to think Cummings will hang on. Albeit with the seemingly Teflon Johnson taking his first major hit in a while... </p>
