		<h2> Everything is Changing but the Polls Still Look the Same </h2>
			<h3> Why Westminster intention polling has not changed despite the Government's U-Turn Summer </h3>

		<time datetime="15-09-2020"> September 15th, 2020 </time>
 <p class="debug-center"> Last week saw the return to Parliament after the Summer recess. However, looking at the Westminster voting intention polls over the summer period you would be forgiven for thinking that nothing had changed. This is the latest round of polling as of writing: </p>

 <div class = 'visualisation'>  <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3737804" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3737804/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div></div>

<p class= 'debug-center'> There has been a fairly standard 2-8 point Conservative lead, aside from an interesting Opinium poll that placed Labour and Conservatives level on 40, the latest Opinium places back a 3 point Conservative lead. These polls may suggest it has been a rather quiet summer. In reality, the government has actually had a tumultuous summer of no less than <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/u-turn-if-you-want-to-11-times-boris-johnson-reversed-government-policy-12056941"> 11 U-Turns </a> including: making facemasks in schools compulsory, extending the ban on evictions, giving students their teacher predicted A-Level Grades, making facemasks in shops compulsory, ordering Huawei to be stripped from UK networks, abandoning the NHS Test and Trace App, the Marcus Rashford backed campaign to give children free school meals over summer, schools to be back before summer, allowing MPs being able to proxy vote in the Commons, scrapping the surcharge fee for foreign health workers and extending the NHS bereavement scheme.  </p>

<p class= 'debug-center'> I believe there are two main reasons why this summer of U-Turns has not changed Westminster voting intentions. The first is fairly simple. People do not mind U-Turns:  </p>

 <div class = 'visualisation'>  <iframe title="When the government does a &quot;U-turn&quot;" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-JJpIK" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JJpIK/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="342"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script> </div>
		
		<p class="debug-center"> I want to point out the Conservative column in particular, this grew from 52% in November to 64% now, it is an opinion that has grown over this last half year. In November 41% of all people agreed with the statement "Government U-turns are normally a good sign - showing they are willing to listen and change their minds when people complain or situations change". This has grown to 49% as of last YouGov polling. YouGov did another poll <a href = "https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2015/03/06/public-relaxed-about-political-u-turns"> way back in 2015 where 41% thought U-Turns were acceptable as it showed politicians listened.</a> Also, the negative connotations of U-Turns often tie to incompetence, something that I have focused on in my last <a href = "https://www.benchurchus.com/100-days-of-starmer"> two </a> <a href = "https://www.benchurchus.com/dominic-cummings-polling"> articles</a>, writing why it does not necessarily translate into voting intention. </p>

		<p class="debug-center"> If U-Turns do not cause people to change their mind, what does? The simple answer to that is, the things that people care about cause them to change their minds. This is where we as a country have seen the most changes over the last year: </p>

		<div class = 'visualisation'> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3742613" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3742613/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> </div>

		<p class="debug-center"> Let's look at the top three issues: Britain Leaving the EU, Health and The Economy. Brexit was dominant over 2019, it was the main issue the Conservatives fought the election campaign on. This was until March where health became a top issue, understandably, due to the Covid-19 crisis. Similarly to the rise of health the economy became a more important issue over a similar timeframe. Until recent polling in which people have seen it as the most important issue facing our country. </p>


		<p class="debug-center"> This is where my second reason why the polls have not changed yet. The Conservatives have not faced public backlash upon the primary issues that concern the public. Whilst the aptitude of the Conservative Government to deal with Covid-19 is debatable at best, they have fallen benefit to a  <a href= "https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/05/09/covid-19-has-given-most-world-leaders-a-temporary-rise-in-popularity"> rally-around-the-flag effect. </a> Stephen Bush articulating this far better than I can stating <a href = “https://www.newstatesman.com/keir-starmer-reshape-labour-future-direction-conservative-liberal”>   “...Conservatives benefiting from the global support for incumbent governments. As part of this trend, politicians as geographically and politically diverse as Israel’s Binyamin Netanyahu and New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern surged in the polls.” </a>  To relate our opening question, Westminster intentions have not changed as people's opinions of our government have improved during the Covid-19 crisis. </p>


		<p class="debug-center"> On the issue Britain Leaving the EU, not much has actually happened yet either. Yes, we officially left on the <a href = "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32810887"> 31st January 2020 </a>. But beyond that there has been a focus on Covid-19 until recently. There was some recent drama with the Internal Market Bill but the size of the <a href = "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54156419"> Government's majority made it a simple bill to pass. </a> I have not seen polling about concerns of "Britain's reputation on an international stage for rule-breaking" but if I were to bet I imagine that a majority of people would not care. </p>

		<p class="debug-center"> Finally on the economy, I have mentioned it in my last blog but it is worth stating again. Rishi Sunak is incredibly popular. Polling has put him as the <a href= "https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/07/10/sunak-most-popular-chancellor-15-years"> most popular Chancellor in 15 years. He's also popular across the board</a>: </p>

		<div class = 'visualisation'>  <iframe title="Who would make the best Chancellor of the Exchequer?" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-kAxc4" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kAxc4/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="246"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); </script> </div>

		<p class="debug-center"> Getting the elephant out of the room, there are a vast amount of Don't Knows, this is a trend across most questions of particular roles of state. The other striking thing is that Labour voters think that Sunak would make a better Chancellor than Dodds. Sunak has cut-through and inspires confidence. In the same YouGov poll that marked him as the most popular Chancellor in 15 years,  <a href= "https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/07/10/sunak-most-popular-chancellor-15-years"> 47% of respondents think that Sunak's policies "Are targeting the right parts of the economy" </a> Sunak's popularity and public confidence has buoyed the Conservative's polling. </p>

		<p class="debug-center"> However, the real impacts of a Covid-19 recession have not happened... yet. In particular unemployment was at a 46 year low at 3.9% in January 2020. Employment was in a strong position pre-Covid. It has grown 0.2% to 4.1% as of latest statistics. </p>

		<div class = 'visualisation'><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3742127" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3742127/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div></div>

		<p class="debug-center">Employment is one barometer of the economic health of a nation. During the 2008 recession, unemployment grew to from 5.7% in 2008 to 7.6% in 2009, hitting a height of 8.1% in 2011. Figures from  <a href = "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54125690"> the IES suggest that planned redundancies will be at twice the rate of the 2008 recession. </a> It would not be beyond the pale to suggest that we will experience the highest year-on-year unemployment since records began between 2020 and 2021. This is alongside the more structural changes to our economy with an emphasis on homeworking and the dominance of online marketplaces over the high street. So far in 2020 furlough has managed to achieve delaying the unemployment effects of a recession, but once <a href = "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52135342"> furlough ends on the 31st October </a> will we be able to stave off new rounds of redundancies and higher rates of unemployment? I doubt it. </p>

		<p class="debug-center"> Furthermore, will Rishi Sunak be as popular when he has to deliver a budget which increases tax? All the while having to juggle the effects of a potential No-Deal Brexit, Covid-19 recession, as well as trying to deliver the Level-Up funding promised to Red Wall seats? There will be undoubtedly hard, and unpopular decisions from the Chancellor. Sunak has said as much to the <a href= "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-tax-rises-shop-steward-a4539301.html"> 1922 committee </a>. If Sunak's popularity takes a hit, it is a bellwether of wider public opinion towards the government on the handling of the economy.

		<p class="debug-center"> With public attention turning back to the economy and Brexit, the Conservativies could find their vote eroded on these issues. They could face switchers to Labour on the economy with Starmer saying that <a href = "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/keir-starmer-says-labour-opposes-tax-rises-while-economy-in-crisis-clhgmfbtf">  "Labour opposes tax rises while economy in crisis: </a> and to the Liberal Democrats on Brexit. These are the situations in which the Westminster polls could change. The government making controversial decisions on the issues of Brexit and the economy are inevitable in the months to come. </p>
